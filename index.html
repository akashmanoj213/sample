			Another eventfull year has passed by and you have now become older and more beautiful than before. Happy 22nd birthday to you :)
		</p>
		<p>
			This year is the most memorable year that you have had in your life till now. The first minute of this year started of with you cutting the cake in Mumbai, a dream trip with your friends that you always wished for. You also had a stranger along with you on this trip who had a little crush on you ;) Little did you know that the stranger would soon become a close part of your life.
			We had so much fun in that trip and made countless memories and best of all I got to meet the most kind hearted and innocent girl that I had ever seen.
		</p>
		<p>
			We became really good friends very fast and then started going together for the ABC classes where we used to study, share and enjoy a lot. I still remember those days where I would come to Jayadeva and wait for you and then we would go together. What I can never forget ever in my life are those times that we used to spend talking about each other while waiting for your return bus home.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are so sweet and innocent that I used to wonder in those days, how someone like you could exist. Somewhere in those talks that we used to have, I fell in love with you and grew more close to you than I ever thought was possible. With you, I feel a sense of comfort and ease that I have never felt with anyone else. I wanted to show my love for you and so I sat out to find a cute little gift for you to tell you how much I love you. And then finally almost a month after your birthday, I got the answer that I was waiting for (yaaaay!)
		</p>
		<p>
			But soon after all the fun we both had together, you had to face the most difficult time of your life :( Ours marks had come and I knew how much you wanted to burst out in tears inside. I was so depressed because I wanted to do something for you and yet there was nothing I could do. I thought your bad time would have finished with that but it had just begun... People around us started getting jobs and we were stuck going here and there day and night. Eventhough i knew how much eagerly you wanted to get a job, I always used to cherish that we were going together. I loved teaching you and sharing with you. Everytime some interview came, I used to look forward to the time we would be spending together rather than preparing for the interview. But even this wouldn't last...
		</p>
		<p>
			Soon the worst news came that I had been selected and that I had to join the company as soon as possible. The first 2 months that I was there was the most depressing 2 months of my life because I knew what you were going through. I wanted to be by your side so much yet I was stuck somewhere else. I wished that I would be able to go along with you for your interviews. I wanted to be there to give you strength and to make you feel that you are not alone. I did everything that I could to let you know that you have someone for you who is always there for you and who cares for you. Each day that I spend in the office knowing that you were sad was pure torture for me. If I had another chance, I wouldn't have gone for that job leaving you alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			But like how the night comes to an end and the Sun comes out, your bad time too had ended and you got into Attra. You had set your mind on getting into Attra and through many small challenges you were determined and worked hard. You showed that you were not just kind and innocent but that you were hard working and determined. You had earned your position and I had felt so so proud. After your Dad and Mom, I was the most happiest person on Earth at that moment. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After almost of a year of hard work, finally you are getting the benefits of it. You have been put into your dream project and now after a long wait, you can start doing something to make a difference in your life and I know you won't waste the opputunity. You will go a long way in your life and you have already started working towards it. I know that you have more potential than most other people. Your only trouble is realising that, yourself. I can feel that you are really loving what you do now and I am happy for you. With your determination and your beautiful character, there is nothing that can stop you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Always remeber, you are never alone. I am always there beside you and will come running towards you if you feel like talking to me no matter what day it is or what time it is. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Love you more that ever...<br />Akash (Kung Fu Panda :D)
